          <p className="text-slate-700">
            Five years ago, I stumbled upon coding out of pure curiosity. I remember the thrill of writing my first "Hello, World!" and realizing I had just instructed a machine to do something. That moment sparked a deep fascinationâ€”I wanted to understand how things worked, how websites came to life, and how I could create something meaningful with just a keyboard.

          <p className="text-slate-700">
            Like most self-taught developers, the beginning was tough. I spent countless nights debugging errors that didn't make sense, wrestling with JavaScript, and questioning if I was cut out for this. But then, I built my first real projectâ€”a simple to-do app. It was nothing groundbreaking, but seeing something I built actually work was a game-changer. That win fueled me to keep pushing forward.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary">Breaking Into the Industry</h3>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            As my skills grew, so did my ambition. I started freelancing, taking on small gigs, and eventually landed my first real software engineering job at CST. It was a whole new levelâ€”working with teams, building scalable applications, and learning how to write clean, maintainable code. This experience reinforced one thing: problem-solving through code was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

          <p className="text-slate-700">
            Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projectsâ€”from mobile apps and web platforms to AI-powered chatbots. Iâ€™ve learned that the best developers arenâ€™t the ones who know everything but the ones who never stop learning. Now, I specialize in full-stack development, building robust applications, and constantly refining my skills to stay ahead.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary">My Philosophy</h3>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            I believe in writing code that is not just functional but also **elegant and maintainable**. To me, great software isn't just about solving a problemâ€”it's about creating an experience. Every project I take on is an opportunity to push boundaries, learn something new, and deliver something that truly matters.

          <p className="text-slate-700">
            When I'm not deep in code, Iâ€™m probably reading, exploring new tech trends, or brainstorming the next big idea. I love working on passion projects, helping other developers, and constantly challenging myself to create something innovative.
